# CSIS2430 - Project 1

## Description
This program demonstrates operations on:

1. Ordinary sets using Boolean arrays
2. Multisets (bags) using integer count arrays

The program computes and displays:

Ordinary set operations:
- Union (A ∪ B)
- Intersection (A ∩ B)
- Difference (A − B)
- Complement (NOT A)
- Symmetric Difference (A ⊕ B)

Multiset operations:
- Union (max counts)
- Intersection (min counts)
- Difference (subtract counts, floor at 0)
- Sum (add counts)
